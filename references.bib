Intrinsic metadata, such as the assigned information class, play an important role in these tasks. With the increasing demand for efficient classification of content components, the sector of technical documentation needs mechanisms that allow for an automation of such tasks. Vector space model based approaches can lead to sufficient results, while maintaining good performance, but they must be adapted to the peculiarities that characterize modular technical documents.In this paper we will present domain specific differences, as well as characteristics, that are special to the field of technical documentation and derive methods to adapt widespread classification and retrieval techniques for these tasks. We verify our approach with data provided from companies in the sector of manufacturing and mechanical engineering and use it for supervised learning and automated classification.},
