    <meta property="og:description" content="<p>Documentation portals
that deliver technical documentation of multiple products to multiple
user groups carry the company’s brand and serve business goals. The
users’ experience in such portals is therefore an important factor.
Findability and context provision typically impact user experience in
content-heavy applications. Two content characteristics that can
influence these UX-relevant factors are classification and
modularization of content. In the past, technical writers handled
classification and modularization of technical documentation when
preparing technical documentation for delivery. However, in the past
decade, processes that typically have been employed to use
classification and modularization to ensure findability and context
provision in technical documentation were extended by additional
technologies or have changed entirely.</p>
<p>Since documentation portals become widespread and integrate more
sources and users, this paper investigates the research question: What
is the relationship between classification and modularization of content
on documentation creation on the one hand and the user experience in a
documentation portal on the other hand? To this end, expert interviews
with software producers were conducted, and documentary sources
reviewed.</p>
<p>The relationship between user experience in documentation portals and
content classification and modularization was found to be moderated by
use cases. With the relationship clarified, issues that surface in
usability tests and user experience research can be addressed in a more
targeted way. The relationship can help understand where in a specific
process the user experience can be influenced and by whom.</p>" />

                    <h2>Description</h3>
                    <p><p>Documentation portals that deliver technical
documentation of multiple products to multiple user groups carry the
company’s brand and serve business goals. The users’ experience in such
portals is therefore an important factor. Findability and context
provision typically impact user experience in content-heavy
applications. Two content characteristics that can influence these
UX-relevant factors are classification and modularization of content. In
the past, technical writers handled classification and modularization of
technical documentation when preparing technical documentation for
delivery. However, in the past decade, processes that typically have
been employed to use classification and modularization to ensure
findability and context provision in technical documentation were
extended by additional technologies or have changed entirely.</p>
<p>Since documentation portals become widespread and integrate more
sources and users, this paper investigates the research question: What
is the relationship between classification and modularization of content
on documentation creation on the one hand and the user experience in a
documentation portal on the other hand? To this end, expert interviews
with software producers were conducted, and documentary sources
reviewed.</p>
<p>The relationship between user experience in documentation portals and
content classification and modularization was found to be moderated by
use cases. With the relationship clarified, issues that surface in
usability tests and user experience research can be addressed in a more
targeted way. The relationship can help understand where in a specific
process the user experience can be influenced and by whom.</p></p>
