## Methods

### Primary Data: Expert Interviews

I conducted interviews with a homogeneous purposive sample of experts of content delivery systems used in technical communication. For the sample, I chose content delivery software vendors and consultants on the Tekom fair for technical communication in Stuttgart, Germany, from 8th to 10th of November 2022. Selection criteria for the experts were knowledge of the system's architecture and the required content structure, as well as knowledge of the types of end users of the portal.

In expert interviews with software vendors and consultants, I attempted to find patterns that indicate a relationship between classification and modularization of the content and the user experience in documentation portals, dependent or not on the respective architecture. I attempted to collect themes that might help to clarify to what extent content structure, content creation and content delivery each play a role in the user experience in documentation portals. To this end, I obtained the experts' opinion about if and how elements of classification and modularization in documentation portals depend on user groups, and if and how user needs ought to be considered on content creation to be reflected in the documentation portal. I asked 7 open and 10 closed questions.

After interviewing 14 experts (12 datasets (2 interviews were with 2 interviewees each)), representing 7 software producers and 3 consultancies, data saturation was reached. Of the companies, 8 were German and 2 international. The interviews were conducted in German and English and translated into English if necessary.

### Analysis of Documentary Sources

The research that I screened in the chapter Literature Review reveals conclusions and results that interact with each other. Cognitive theories such as relevance theory or information foraging theory can put the results of other research in a perspective that can help understand the relationship between classification and modularization of content and user experience in applications such as documentation portals. I will therefore analyze this research about content delivery, metrics in portal-like applications and cognitive theories to inform my conclusion on a relationship between classification and modularization of content and user experience in documentation portals.

I used the library of the Strasbourg University, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Journal of Usability Studies and the publications of the institute for information and content management (i4icm.de) to find relevant research in English and German. I used free publications preferably published after 2015. I used my list of viewpoints from the Introduction to sort candidate publications.
